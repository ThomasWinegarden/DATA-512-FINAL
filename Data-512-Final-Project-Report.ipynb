    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In October of this year the King County Library System (KCLS) announced that it would [no longer purchase newly released eBooks from Macmillan Publishers](https://kcls.org/news/kcls-boycotts-macmillan-publishers-ebook-embargo/) starting November 1st, 2019. This came in response to [Macmillan Publishers decision to place an embargo on sales of ebooks to US libraries](https://www.publishersweekly.com/binary-data/ARTICLE_ATTACHMENT/file/000/004/4222-1.pdf) due to the effects digital checkouts were having on ebook sales. This decision by Macmillan will also be affecting The Seattle Public Library (SPL) and news of the embargo and its possible effects have motivated me to understand and investigate the impact this may have on Seattle's readers. I urge readers of this report to read NPR's article on the issues at hand, ['You May Have To Wait To Borrow A New E-Book From The Library'](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775150979/you-may-have-to-wait-to-borrow-a-new-e-book-from-the-library).\n",

    "This notebook is a final project for The University of Washington's Human Centered Data Science course (DATA 512) taught by [Jonathan Morgan](https://jtmorgan.net/). This notebook based report is meant to meet and exceed the [assignment 7 requirements](https://wiki.communitydata.science/Human_Centered_Data_Science_(Fall_2019)/Assignments#A7:_Final_project_report) and was modeled after [Rex Thompson's Report on Paid Street Parking](https://github.com/rexthompson/DATA-512-Final-Project/blob/master/DATA-512-Final-Project.ipynb) per instructor recommendation.\n",

    "#### Research Question 2 (Revised): If SPL were to have boycotted Macmillan in 2018, what would the impact have been?\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Fans of fiction novels will be the largest effected when we examine checkouts by subject for Macmillan. Though Macmillan only consists of 5% of digital checkouts, I believe this will have a noticable impact to many readers. There are many titles from the 2018 list that are well known and best sellers and if Macmillan authors continue to publish some best seller every year then the fiction fans will be upset they will not have immediate access via the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though it is difficult to predict the scale of impact in future years if SPL were to boycott. I believe I can confidently claim that by using 2018 as a baseline proxy that over 35,000 checkouts per year would be affected. This would mean readers would have to go elsewhere to satisfy their demand. This also comes with a financial impact for Macmillan. This is what they are expecting in some ways however, and their financial analysis led them to make this embargo decision. It will be interesting to see how this evolves as more data is released. I am particularly interested on how long KCLS will continue to boycott and if Seattle joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Seattle Library System needs to be very careful when making the decision to boycott Macmillan Publishers. At the moment they are staying on the safe side and not joining KCLS in boycotting. I believe that this is actually in the best interest of Seattle readers especially specific populations such as people with disabilities, mobility issues, or even location issues. I think a field study that is human focused on SPL readers should be carried out before they join in. It also needs to be said that Seattle may see some of the demand for Macmillan ebooks shifted over from KCLS to them and as a provider for those with issues above they morally should continue to provide and not boycott.\n"
